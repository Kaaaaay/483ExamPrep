             replace a hidden word. Store atleast eight words in an array and randomly select
             one to be the hidden word. Initially, display the hidden word using asterisks
             to represent each letter. Allow the user to guess letters to replace the
             asterisks in the hidden word until the user completes the entire word. If the 
             user guesses a letter that is not in the hidden word, display an appropriate
             message. If the user guesses a letter that appears multiple times in the hidden
             word, make sure that each correct letter is placed.
